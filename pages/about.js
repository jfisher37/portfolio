            <span class="indent"> I </span> am an aspiring web developer, currently studying at Penn LPS's Bootcamp. My background is in education. I have my M.S.Ed from UPenn, with a specialization in second language acquisition. So, as you might have guessed, I'm a huge language nerd - I'm fluent in Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Oh, and English too, I guess.
