            I'm a full-stack web developer based in Philadelphia, PA. In addition to web development, I have a background in second language education, with an M.S.Ed from the University of Pennsylvania. Basically, I'm a huge language nerd - I'm fluent in Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And English too, I guess.
